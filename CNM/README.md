# IoT Bootcamp: Liquid Prep Soil Moisture Monitor

## The goal of this project is to develop a smart, internet connected soil moisture sensor to be integrated into IBM's Liquid Prep app. To do this, recent IoT Bootcamp graduates developed code for Particle Gen 3 microcontrollers to communicate analog data from a capacitive soil moisture sensor data via bluetooth and WiFi. The Adafruit BlueFruit app for iOS and Android is used to receive UART bluetooth data. Also, data is visualized on an Adafruit.io dashboard which allows the user to track soil moisture over time.

# About the Students

### Janel Sanchez

A student from the Deep Dive Internet of Things Cohort 3, which allowed her the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of creating and coding smart connected devices. Coming from a medical background and a strong passion to help in her community, Janel seeks to find opportunities that aid in kindness and positive change. By taking the bootcamp she was able to incorporate new STEM skills that she hopes to pass on to future generations.

In this project she was able to contribute in the planning of the project as well as design from the beginning to end stages. From incorporation code previously learned in the bootcamp to cutting and welding metal pieces together and powder coating them, she enjoyed being able to be part of a team that is set out to make a difference in the world.


### Christian Chavez

Christian is a recent graduate of CNM Ingenuity's Internet of Things Coding and Hardware Design bootcamp. He is currently working as a Technical Resident at CNM's Technology Solutions Labs under the direction of Dr. Brian Rashap. Christian helped to write code and design hardware for the Liquid Prep Soil Moisture Project.
